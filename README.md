# Password-Generator

## Description 

This employee password generator is a simple, conscise javascript codebase. It's mainly built from strings, prompts, confirms, while loops and if/else conditional statements. Once the user access the page, the password generator prompts a question, asking the user how many characters they want in their password. The prompt is powered through an if conditional statement telling the user to choose their desired password length between 8 to 128 characters. An alert is built in through an if conditional statement informing users to they have to stay within the password length range. Proceeding after the prompt is a series of confirms giving users their choice of character types through a series of boolean if else statements, OK (true) and Cancel (false). After clicking through all the confirms, the users password will be genereated of their desired length.
